## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This e-commerce platform is built using a microservices architecture that provides:

- **Scalability**: Independent services that can be scaled individually
- **Resilience**: Service failures don't bring down the entire platform
- **Developer Experience**: Monorepo structure with shared packages and consistent tooling
- **Real-time Communication**: Event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka
